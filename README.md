# untitled.project.7

Uses `matter.js` for physics (and rendering).

Two grounds and an asteroid field in the middle.
Min resolution is 800*600, more and it will maximize available window. 

Controls:
* `w`, `up arrow` for engines on.
* `a`, `left arrow` to turn left; `d`, `right arrow` for right.
* `q` and `e` for rotating left or right, respectively.
