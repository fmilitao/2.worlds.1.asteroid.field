# untitled.project.7

Uses [matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) for physics (and rendering).

Two grounds and an asteroid field in the middle.
Minimum resolution is 800*600, more space and it will maximize to available window. 

Controls:
* `w`, `up arrow` for engines on.
* `a`, `left arrow` to turn left; `d`, `right arrow` for right.
* `q` and `e` for rotating left or right, respectively.
* `s`, `down arrow` for "brakes".

[Online demo](http://fmilitao.github.io/untitled.project.7/test.html).

No real objective, just experimenting the physiscs engine...
